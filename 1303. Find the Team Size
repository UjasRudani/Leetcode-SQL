### Solution 1: Group By + Equi-Join
We can first count the number of people in each team and record it in the `T` table. Then, we can use an equi-join to join the `Employee` table and the `T` table based on `team_id`, and obtain the total number of people in each team.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT team_id, COUNT(1) AS team_size
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT employee_id, team_size
FROM
    Employee
    JOIN T USING (team_id);

### Solution 2: Left Join
We can also use a left join to join the `Employee` table with itself based on `team_id`, and then group by `employee_id` to count the total number of people in each team that the employee belongs to.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e1.employee_id, COUNT(1) AS team_size
FROM
    Employee AS e1
    LEFT JOIN Employee AS e2 USING (team_id)
GROUP BY 1;
